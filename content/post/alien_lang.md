A few alien explorers from a galaxy far away visit Earth, and they want to communicate with us humans, for which they need a language. They could have used sign language but they don't. It's not clear whether it's a cultural thing or that they might want to exchange more than the usual cry of "Bob" while pointing a body appendage towards self and then towards you(at which point you say your name or faint).

So these ultra intelligent life forms that have traveled inter-stellar distances to meet with us folks set out to create a new language which can be easily understood by both alien and human. The only problem is that the alien is advanced to human by more than a million and close to a billion years. So they sit down and form a committee. As you can see they are not so different after all.

You can imagine them to be a group of three. Two middle-aged aliens and a wise old alien. They are all very chummy and stuff and they fight and debate and come up with a specification for the aforesaid language and christen it, "the mighty gopher hates coffee beans and loves big snakes of the sea" as per their customary traditional practice of naming new languages.

The meeting went something like this.

"So we all agree that the language should have the basic constructs to allow these puny humans to understand our vast alien knowledge", said Bob

"Yes, we can't really talk to them in our conventional multi-dimensional speech now, can we", piped in Pipeson.

"Yep, the last mud world we tried teaching our galaxy language to, misunderstood us for invaders. Invaders! We are only glorified geologists for universe sake", said Grizzly while scratching his second head with his fifth arm.

"The language is barely published and there are mass humans protests all across Earth accusing us of duplicity. Just yesterday, I walked by a group of ugly humans holding placards saying, "We are not dumb!" and "We are intelligent too!" and stuff like that. I didn't get the, "Stomp the cockroach"  one, whatever that means", said Pipeson.

"See, we all know in our vast alien intelligence that lesser building blocks for a language is a good thing. I don't think they will ever understand. In any case, I think we have enough humans convinced to progress the language", exclaimed Bob.

"What about the rest of the puny humans?", asked Grizzly. "Ah, I don't know, shoot them with our atomizer guns?"

"Well, the biologists are looking for specimens".

Meanwhile a group of red-orange aliens are about to begin their landing cycle in crate shaped ships whilst a bunch of engineers from  Planet D are still fueling their ship at the last stopover.

I guess you get the drift.
