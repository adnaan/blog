            <p>A few alien explorers from a galaxy far away visit Earth, and they want to communicate with us humans, for which they need a language. They could have used sign language but they don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s not clear whether it&rsquo;s a cultural thing or that they might want to exchange more than the usual cry of &ldquo;Bob&rdquo; while pointing a body appendage towards self and then towards you(at which point you say your name or faint).</p>
<p>So these ultra intelligent life forms that have traveled inter-stellar distances to meet with us folks set out to create a new language which can be easily understood by both alien and human. The only problem is that the alien is advanced to human by more than a million and close to a billion years. So they sit down and form a committee. As you can see they are not so different after all.</p>
<p>You can imagine them to be a group of three. Two middle-aged aliens and a wise old alien. They are all very chummy and stuff and they fight and debate and come up with a specification for the aforesaid language and christen it, &ldquo;the mighty gopher hates coffee beans and loves big snakes of the sea&rdquo; as per their customary traditional practice of naming new languages.</p>
<p>The meeting went something like this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we all agree that the language should have the basic constructs to allow these puny humans to understand our vast alien knowledge&rdquo;, said Bob</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we can&rsquo;t really talk to them in our conventional multi-dimensional speech now, can we&rdquo;, piped in Pipeson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, the last mud world we tried teaching our galaxy language to, misunderstood us for invaders. Invaders! We are only glorified geologists for universe sake&rdquo;, said Grizzly while scratching his second head with his fifth arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The language is barely published and there are mass humans protests all across Earth accusing us of duplicity. Just yesterday, I walked by a group of ugly humans holding placards saying, &ldquo;We are not dumb!&rdquo; and &ldquo;We are intelligent too!&rdquo; and stuff like that. I didn&rsquo;t get the, &ldquo;Stomp the cockroach&rdquo;  one, whatever that means&rdquo;, said Pipeson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, we all know in our vast alien intelligence that lesser building blocks for a language is a good thing. I don&rsquo;t think they will ever understand. In any case, I think we have enough humans convinced to progress the language&rdquo;, exclaimed Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the rest of the puny humans?&quot;, asked Grizzly. &ldquo;Ah, I don&rsquo;t know, shoot them with our atomizer guns?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the biologists are looking for specimens&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a group of red-orange aliens are about to begin their landing cycle in crate shaped ships whilst a bunch of engineers from  Planet D are still fueling their ship at the last stopover.</p>
